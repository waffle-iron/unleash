# Contributing

## Issues on board

Before contributing please go to our [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/x-team/unleash) and find an issue you would like to work on.


## Branch naming

We use the the automated [Waffle workflow](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking) - please get yourself acustomed with it first.

Basically the idea is that when you start working on an issue, create a new branch containing the number of the issue and push it to origin. This will automatically assign you to the task and put it in the "in progress" column.

### Example

I have chosen issue 21 (f.e. about fixing the layout) to work on so I update my develop branch:

```
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```
Then accordingly to Waffle worfklow I create a branch and push it to origin:

```
git checkout -b fixing_the_layout-#21
git push origin fixing_the_layout-#21
```
Now I am automatically assigned to the issue and it's in progress.

Whenever I'm done I will push the changes again and create a PR

## PR naming

Please add the word "fixes" and issue number in the PR title. So following the example above my PR would be titled for example: `Change Layout - fixes #21`

## Testing

Before submitting a PR please run tests on your branch.

In order to run tests please type:
```
docker-compose run web npm run test
```

In order to run lint please type:
```
docker-compose run web npm run test:lint
```

## Nice to have

- Would be nice if every PR had 1 commit only - you can squash your commits into 1 commit before submitting a PR.
- Would be nice if whenever there are visual changes your PR contained a screenshot
- Would be nice if the commit messages followed git's built-in conventions. Read more [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
